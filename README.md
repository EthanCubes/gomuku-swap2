# Gomuku (Swap2)
A east asian board game simular to tic-tac-toe, except it's played on a 15x15 board and you need to get 5 in a row to win.

[Play it here]()
## Quickstart
Download the game files from Itch.io according to your operating system, and run them.

If you're on Linux, I'm so sorry I can't give you a dedicated version for you, but just run the windows version with Wine. I'd assume you know how to use Wine already, but here's how to download wine just in case:
In the terminal:
- Arch-based systems: ```sudo pacman -S wine```
- Everything else, probably: ```sudo apt install wine```
Then just like doubleclick the .exe file or run ```wine /path/to/the/exe/gomuku-swap2.exe```

## Features
- A main menu with 3 clickable buttons that each do their own thing.
- A 15x15 Go board 
that Gomuku is played on.
- A local multiplayer mode that allows for you to play against your IRL friends (or yourself if you have no friends)
- A bot that is somewhat intelligent and actively responds to your threats and creates it's own threats.
- Background music that is somewhat annoying.

## How to run code locally
Requires Python 3.12.13 and Pygame 2.6.1 (Note that the project will still technically work inside of the newer Python versions, but on 3.14.6 specifically the music is broken). You will probably have to install them inside of a venv since this program uses an older version of Python as aforementioned.
Clone the project from GitHub, then run main.py.

## How it works
Pygame creates a window and draws lines to form the game board. Circles are drawn to represent stones according to the board positions list. Clicking on a spot on the board uses math to find which spot the stone should be placed at, and together with the current turn changes the list of board positions to include the placed stone.

To figure out when the game is over, an algorithm scans the board every frame to see if there is any five-in-a-rows, and returns their position if yes in order to draw a line highlighting the winning pattern.

### For the bot, well.........

There are two reasons why the bot may make a move. 1 is that the bot needs to defend, and 2 is that the bot needs to attack. Mostly defense is prioritied above offence, except when the offence creates a threat that outweighs the current threat needing to be defended.

To find places to attack or defend, a function scans in all 8 directions for all 225 possible spots (1800 iterations in total) and compares the iterations against a specified pattern, for example [0,1,1,1,0] is an open 3 and [0,1,1,1,1,0] is impending doom (open four). If it finds a position, it will add it to a list of positions, which is returned to the analyze function to be analyzed. The analyze function eventually returns a set of coordinates that the bot will place a stone at, in around the same way that a user might place a stone.
